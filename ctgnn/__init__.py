Python package containing the code for the experiments from the ICLR 2024
MLGenX workshop poster "Cell-Type Prediction in Spatial Transcriptomics Data
using Graph Neural Networks".

The package contains the following modules:
- `data`: Contains the code for loading and processing the spatial
    transcriptomics data.
- `evaluation`: Contains some helper functions for evaluating the experiments.
- `nn`: Contains the definitions of the (graph) neural networks used in the
    experiments.
- `trainer`: Contains the code for the hyperparameter search and training of
    the models using PyTorch Ignite.
- `utils`: Contains some utility functions used in the experiments.

For more information, please refer to the __init__.py files in the respective
modules.
